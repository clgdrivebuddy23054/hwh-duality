## 📌 The Challenge: Space Station Safety
Space stations are high-risk environments where misplaced tools or hazardous objects can cause catastrophic accidents.  

🔹 Even a floating screwdriver can become a deadly projectile in zero gravity.  
🔹 Our mission: **Develop an AI system that automatically detects safety-critical objects to protect astronauts.**

---

## 🛠 Our Beginner-Friendly Approach
- **Pre-trained Models** → Leverage YOLOv8 and similar models to avoid starting from scratch.  
- **Small Dataset Focus** → Concentrate on detecting a few key safety objects (tools, equipment, debris).  
- **Practical Prototype** → Build a simple working demo with real-world applications.  

---

## 💻 Technology Stack
- **Duality Falcon Platform** → For training and deployment.  
- **Python Essentials** → OpenCV, NumPy, and basic ML libraries.  
- **Lightweight ML** → TensorFlow Lite & PyTorch for real-time object detection.  

---

## 📂 Step-by-Step Execution Plan
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing** – Gather/clean images, label safety objects.  
2. **Model Training** – Fine-tune pretrained YOLOv8 models on space station data.  
3. **Testing & Validation** – Evaluate with mAP@50, test edge cases, optimize confidence thresholds.  
4. **Final Report & Demo** – Present findings, demo hazard detection use case.

## 🌍 Real-World Use Case: Preventing Space Accidents
**Scenario:** Floating Hazards Detection  
- Continuous monitoring of compartments.  
- Detects loose tools, debris, misplaced equipment.  
- Alerts astronauts before hazards cause damage.  

**Impact:**  
- Early warning system → Prevents accidents.  
- Real-time monitoring → Safer work areas.  
- Instant notifications → Quick crew response.
